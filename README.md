<h1>OpenSource Project</h1>
<h2><b>Question:</b> Use any open source tool to find partial and full multimedia files(video files) in DataStream.
Explore any other five features from the same software.
</h2>
<h3>What need to be done! : In this question, we are required to perform the following tasks:</h3>
<img src="assets/ftk.jpeg" alt="FTK Imager" >

<p>
<ul>
<l>Use an open-source tool to find partial and full multimedia files, specifically video files, in a given data stream.</l>

<l>Explore five other features of the same software.</l>
</ul>
To accomplish the first task, you could use a tool such as FTK Imager, as mentioned in your original project question. This tool has the capability to search for multimedia files in data streams and can be used to find video files.

For the second task, you would need to explore other features of the same software used in the first task. For example, FTK Imager has several other features such as:

Disk imaging: The ability to create and analyze disk images of digital storage devices.
Deleted file recovery: The ability to recover deleted files from a digital storage device.
Internet history analysis: The ability to analyze internet history and cookies to determine browsing activity.
Email artifact analysis: The ability to analyze email artifacts such as headers, message bodies, and attachments.
Metadata analysis: The ability to extract and analyze metadata from files such as timestamps, location, and device information.
By exploring these features, you can gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of the software and how it can be used in digital forensics investigations.</p>
