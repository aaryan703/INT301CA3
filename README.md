<h1>OpenSource Project</h1>
<h2><b>Question:</b> Use any open source tool to find partial and full multimedia files(video files) in DataStream.
Explore any other five features from the same software.
</h2>
<h3>What need to be done! : In this question, we are required to perform the following tasks:</h3>
<img src="assets/ftk.jpeg" alt="FTK Imager" >

<p>
<ul>
<l># Use an open-source tool to find partial and full multimedia files, specifically video files, in a given data stream.</l>

<l>Explore five other features of the same software.</l>
</ul>
To accomplish the first task, you could use a tool such as FTK Imager, as mentioned in your original project question. This tool has the capability to search for multimedia files in data streams and can be used to find video files.

For the second task, you would need to explore other features of the same software used in the first task. For example, FTK Imager has several other features such as:

Disk imaging: The ability to create and analyze disk images of digital storage devices.
Deleted file recovery: The ability to recover deleted files from a digital storage device.
Internet history analysis: The ability to analyze internet history and cookies to determine browsing activity.
Email artifact analysis: The ability to analyze email artifacts such as headers, message bodies, and attachments.
Metadata analysis: The ability to extract and analyze metadata from files such as timestamps, location, and device information.
By exploring these features, you can gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of the software and how it can be used in digital forensics investigations.</p>

<h3>Description Of The Entire Project</h3>
<img src="assets/Screenshot (2).png" alt="FTK Imager" >

<p>FTK Imager is a powerful open-source forensic tool used for analyzing digital data in investigations. It allows users to extract data from hard drives, disk images, and other digital storage devices. One of the main features of FTK Imager is its ability to search for multimedia files, specifically video files, in a given data stream.

Using FTK Imager, users can search for both partial and full multimedia files in a data stream. The software provides a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of file formats, including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MOV. It also includes advanced search features, such as the ability to filter search results by file type, size, and creation date.

In addition to its multimedia file search capabilities, FTK Imager offers several other features that make it a valuable tool for digital forensics investigations. These include the ability to create and analyze disk images, recover deleted files, and analyze internet history and email artifacts. It also provides tools for metadata analysis, keyword searching, and timeline analysis, which can help investigators reconstruct a sequence of events.

Overall, FTK Imager is a reliable and efficient tool for finding multimedia files in data streams. Its comprehensive search capabilities, user-friendly interface, and advanced features make it a valuable tool for digital forensic investigations.

<h3> Step by Step process of the project </h3>
<p> --> Open FTK Imager and click on the "File" menu, then select "Add Evidence Item."

--> In the "Add Evidence Item" dialog box, select "Physical Drive" and click on the "Browse" button to select the drive containing the DataStream.
</p>

--> Once the drive is selected, click on the "Finish" button to add the drive to FTK Imager.
<img src="assets/Screenshot (7).png" alt="FTK Imager" >
<p>
--> Now click on "create disk image". The "Create Disk Image" option in FTK Imager allows you to create a forensic image of a physical drive or logical volume. A disk image is an exact copy of the original source drive, including all files, folders, and system information. The purpose of creating a disk image is to preserve the original data and maintain its integrity for forensic analysis.

<p>
Verify the image: It's important to verify the integrity of the image to ensure that it's an exact copy of the original source. To do this, you can use the "Verify Image" option in FTK Imager and compare the hash values of the original drive and the image file.
</p>
